# VBA-Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to build proficiency with the general idea of coding while using excel as a familiar starting point. There is a provided dataset that I
use to achieve the following:

 Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
